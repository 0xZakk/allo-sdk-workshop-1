# Allo Protocol Workshop 1 - Using the SDK


Why am I learning this?

The Allo Protocol is a new way to build applications for funding and allocating resources. It is a new way to build applications that are more fair, more transparent, and more open.

## Introduction

The Allo Protocol is a new way to build applications for funding and allocating resources. It is a new way to build applications that are more fair, more transparent, and more open.


## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- [ ] Understand the essential parts Allo Protocol
- [ ] Implement the Allo SDK to create a new Strategy(Pool) and Profile
- [ ] 


## Preparation

Fork and clone this repository.

Create a new branch from start, training, for your work.

Checkout to the training branch.

Install dependencies with npm install.

Better preparation instructions may be found as snippets.


It's a good idea to have students do these steps while you're writing objectives on the whiteboard.


## Demo

Demos are demonstrations, and developers should give their full attention to them. It's a great time for them to take notes about important concepts before applying them in an exercise.

Demos correspond to the "I do" portion of scaffolding from consultant training.


## Code Along

During the code-along, developers should apply concepts covered in the previous demo, led by the consultant. This is their first chance to generalize concepts introduced. Exercises should be very focused, and flow natural into a lab.

Exercises correspond to the "We do" portion of scaffolding from consultant training.


## Lab

During labs, developers get to demonstrate their understanding of concepts from demos and applied knowledge from exercises. Labs are an opportunity for developers to build confidence, and also serve as a diagnostic tool for consultants to evaluate developer understanding.

Labs should be timed explicitly using a timer. When estimating the time it will take to complete a lab, it is better to overestimate. During labs, consultants should circle the room and interact with developers, noting patterns and prompting with hints on how to complete the lab. If developers end early, a consultant may stop the lab timer. If developers do not finish in time, a consultant may give more time at her discretion based on current talk pace, the current estimate for the talk, and the importance of completing the lab while consultant support is available.

Labs correspond to the "You do" portion of scaffolding from consultant training.


## Resources

Any useful links should be included in the talk material where the link is first referenced.

Additional links for further study or exploration are appropriate in this section.

Links to important parts of documentation not covered during the talk, or tools tangentially used but not part of the focus of the talk, are also appropriate.
